# Deepspeech_Colab
I was struggling to get a headstart on finetuning the deepspeech model on colab's GPU to convert speech to text and hence compiled these notebooks for
anyone looking for help.

## Usage
- Execute "before_training" to preprocess the data so that the deepspeech model can be trained on it.
- Run "finetune_deepspeech_colab" to get a finetuned model on your own dataset.
- It uses colab's GPU to finetune Mozilla's deepspeech model.
